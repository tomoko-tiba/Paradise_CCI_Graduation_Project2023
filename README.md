**Design Background**

My project stems from a family gathering where I overheard my aunt loudly telling my mom, "Your daughter's legs are too fat." On the way back home, I complained to my mom, saying that my aunt's criticism of my body was very impolite. My mom's response was that we cannot control what others say. Others criticize you because the fact is that your legs are thick. At that point, my dad chimed in, suggesting that if I didn't want people to talk about me that way, I should simply wear long pants. I felt a deep sense of frustration during this exchange but found myself unable to effectively counter their arguments.

This experience is merely a common occurrence in my family. In China, there are numerous societal standards imposed on women, including being slender, fair-skinned, having a gentle personality, and enjoying housework, among others. When you don't conform to these standards, people feel entitled to criticize you. Should you attempt to push back, you may, like me, encounter even more criticism. This prevalent phenomenon prompted me to ponder **why so many women in Chinese society willingly uphold these patriarchal social standards and even use them to criticize other women.** Simultaneously, based on these reflections, I explored the **male gaze**, **societal norms**, and **their impacts on women** in my project.

### Research: Challenges Faced by Chinese Women

In my research, digital ethnography has been instrumental in exploring the narratives of women across diverse digital platforms. By analyzing content from social media, interview programs, and documentaries, I have compiled a comprehensive collection of 23 real-life female stories. Among these narratives, the story of **Liu Xiaoyang** from the CCTV program "Half the Sky" is particularly notable. She represents a woman with modern thoughts yet constrained by traditional female stereotypes, struggling to pursue her true aspirations due to societal norms. These narratives provide a rich tapestry of experiences, reflecting the multifaceted nature of women's lives in the digital age.

In an interview with a rural woman, XiaoYang Liu, conducted twenty years ago, she mentioned:

  - "Before a girl gets married, she belongs to her parents' family; after marriage, she belongs to her husband's family. "

  - "I have my own house, well-behaved children, and a loyal husband. **Others say that's already good enough.** But I'm not satisfied with just these. I want a fulfilling life; I want knowledge; I want to read books; I want to watch television to gain what I desire **because I can't go outside.** "

  - "If you break the conventional rules, you will feel helpless, hopeless, and lonely, **as if many eyes are watching you.** You don't need anyone to stop you; you will willingly abide by these rules."

  - "**I'd rather be in pain; I don't want to be numb.** I don't want to be someone who is content but knows nothing."

Over the past twenty years, her thoughts remain innovative and thought-provoking. Unlike XiaoYang, today's women in China have the right to access education, but some challenges faced by her still persist:
  1. **Overemphasizing the importance of “love" for women.** Pressuring women to be content with being subservient to men and using marital status as a measure of a woman's worth. 
  2. **Male gazing and regulation of women.** XiaoYang also mentioned these rules: "You can't be too bad, and you can't be too good." These rules still apply twenty years later, and they have become even more detailed as society has evolved.
  3. **Numbing women's thoughts and depriving them of self-awareness.** In Chinese family upbringing, the most common phrase is, “Girls don't need to read too many books."

**The Brainwashing Methods of Patriarchal Thinking in Modern Society**

How does patriarchal ideology affect women? In modern society, as women have gained independence of thought, conventional preaching and oppressive methods are no longer as effective. Consequently, **it conceals itself within media and culture, such as movies and novels, where patriarchy is repackaged as romantic plotlines**, subtly implanting itself in the minds of women.

Firstly, in the portrayal of female **protagonists** in Chinese television dramas, **women's growth often depends on the help of men**. The kind but naive girl is always waiting for the rescue of her white knight. As Simone de Beauvoir mentioned in "The Second Sex" “**To be feminine is to show oneself as weak, futile, passive, and docile.** The girl is supposed not only to primp and dress herself up but also to repress her spontaneity and substitute for it the grace and charm she has been taught by her elder sisters. Any self-assertion will take away from her femininity and her seductiveness.”。

Secondly, female **supporting characters** often conform to **stereotypical images** under the gaze of patriarchy. For example, women who pursue power and status often use their bodies and appearance as shortcuts. Moreover, Female leadership roles are typically portrayed as unpopular figures. In the Chinese context, the term "女强人" (nü qiang ren), originally referring to a successful career woman, has taken on a pejorative connotation, representing a woman with a strong personality who is difficult to get along with and is not well-liked by men.

These movies, novels, and media achieve the brainwashing of women by** glorifying patriarchy** and creating deceptive happiness for women. In these storylines, women appear to receive preferential treatment, and they don't need to put effort into studying and working because men will provide them with emotional and especially financial support. **Women seem to have easier choices, but this solidifies gender inequality.** As Lindsey German once mentioned in "Theories of Patriarchy," female liberation needs to begin with an assessment of the material position of women in capitalist society."

"Girls don't need to work so hard." I've heard it countless times during my upbringing. People encourage women to choose jobs that are less demanding, with lower stress levels and more free time. It means having more time to take care of the family. Negatively speaking, such jobs often come with lower salaries, higher replaceability, and lower competitiveness in the workplace. This seemingly woman-centric perspective, in reality, weakens women's power and status. **What's even more alarming is that this kind of thinking is adopted as a behavioral norm by a significant number of women.**

In the Chinese version of "The Second Sex," there may be a more precise description of such phenomena. "The great fortune of man lies in the fact that, whether in adulthood or childhood, he must embark upon an exceedingly arduous path, yet this is also the most reliable path. The misfortune of woman, on the other hand, is to be surrounded by almost irresistible temptations; everything entices her to take the easy road. She is not required to strive upwards, to walk her own path; **she is told that simply by sliding downward, she can reach the paradise of bliss.** When she discovers that she has been fooled by a mirage, it is already too late; her strength has been exhausted in futile adventures." (From "The Second Sex," Page 728)

How to make women consciously adhere to and uphold patriarchy? It constructs a pink paradise for women, where they are promised love, an effortless life path, and the belief that enhancing their appearance will yield more resources. **It leads women to believe that as long as they conform to patriarchal social standards and cater to the male gaze, they can obtain the maximum benefits.** However, behind this paradise lies patriarchy, which often includes any social, political, or economic mechanism that evokes male dominance over women. **Because patriarchy is a social construction, it can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.** This is especially crucial for teenagers, who, due to their less mature cognitive development, are more susceptible to the temptation of such a deceptive paradise. **Only by shattering the illusions of this paradise can we awaken the self-awareness of more women and propel the achievement of gender equality.**

  A 30 minutes exploration of being a teenaged girl struggling with what girls should or should not be.


### Game style thoughts

### - Plan 1

The game is set in a pink paradise, primarily composed of scenes resembling a household, such as bedrooms and kitchens, symbolizing the stereotypical daily life of women. Within this paradise, you will encounter many women look like Barbie dolls, all sharing the same appearance, representing the standardized image of women. <br>
However, The character controlled by the player looks very different from the other women, as she does not conform to the mainstream aesthetic. **Because her appearance is not recognized by the evaluation system in the paradise, the player faces attacks from other characters,** with the attacks being manifested in the form of language, represented as tangible bullets when the player encounters other characters. <br>
Actually, the true antagonists in the paradise are not these women characters but** a gigantic eye **at the center of the paradise. **Characters have become hostile due to the mental contamination caused by the boss's influence.** The player's skills can temporarily restore clarity to these characters,** and the player needs to find clues within the scenes and help the characters regain their consciousness through chatting.**

### - Plan 2

Based on the concept of 'Paradise', a theme park is chosen as the setting for the elements. Players are taken into a fantasy world named 'Paradise', where they must help Barbie - the protagonist's alternate personality created in the real world due to societal pressures and patriarchal ideology - realize her true self, rather than being a slave to perfection standards. By destroying the brainwave control device, players will help Barbie reshape her brain, regain self-awareness, and escape Paradise together to return to the real world and be herself again.

 <br>
 
## Week 03 Further Attempts Based on Plan 1

**Setup Game Mechanics**
  1. Use skills to calm down the character **temporarily**, preventing her from attacking you.
  2. After finding clues within the scene, engage in dialogue with characters to awaken their self-awareness.
  3. Awakened characters will no longer attack the player
  4. When the player is hit, the sounds of these verbal attacks are played. 
  5. If the player is repeatedly hit, they will lose consciousness, lose the game.
  6. Awakened characters will provide the player with an energy sphere, and when the player collects all the energy spheres, they use them to defeat the boss and complete the game.

**Employing collage techniques for the construction of reference materials for the Boss's image.**

**Challenges encountered:**

1. The difficulty in directly importing materials created with Blender nodes into the game engine, necessitating a material baking process. Individually baking every object in the scene would be time-consuming. Additionally, the plethora of exported texture maps demands considerable time in matching each object with its respective material during the importation into the game engine.

2. The use of a pink aesthetic led to a visual presentation that skewed too young, akin to a children's game. My intention is for the game to convey a more serious tone, rendering the current approach inappropriate.

**Creating UI Interface and Game Cover in UE5**

## Week 04 Further Attempts Based on Plan 2

**Setup Game Mechanics** 

To make the player's objectives clearer during the game, here are the specific steps for the game design:

1. **Objective Identification and Interaction with Machines**: Set in a virtual space named "Paradise", the player's primary task is to locate and shoot multiple machines scattered throughout the game scene.
2. **Collection and Evasion Mechanics**: Machines drop "Voice Modules" when shot, which are key elements used to control the protagonist Barbie's thoughts. Players need to collect all these modules while dodging attacks from Barbie, and then destroy them.
3. **Deactivation of Control and Conflict Avoidance**: When all modules are damaged, Barbie will no longer be controlled and will cease her attacks on the player.
4. **Final Dialogue and Awakening**: In the final stage of the game, the player will converse with Barbie to help awaken her self-awareness, and eventually leave "Paradise" together, returning to the real world.

## Week 05 Design and 3d Modelling

**Design enemy character**

I based the 3D model on the collage image I made earlier. Initially, I set the enemy as a large fixed-position machine, but later I thought that simplifying the enemy into a small machine floating in the sky would make the game more interesting, so I changed the plan. 

I have also integrated elements of **eyeballs** into the design of the machine, creating a sensation for players of being under scrutiny. This is intended to symbolize the machine as an embodiment of the **male gaze**.

<img height="400" src="https://github.com/tomoko-tiba/Paradise_CCI_Graduation_Project2023/assets/41440180/99a930db-d0a6-4221-9781-ce59f5d37d01">

**Selection of color**  

![image](https://github.com/tomoko-tiba/Paradise_CCI_Graduation_Project2023/assets/41440180/97c58696-ba62-48ed-9a55-621f95c71122)

After importing the model into UE5, it loses the material effects adjusted in the Blender nodes. It is necessary to adjust the materials again in UE5, such as reducing the material's metallicity and giving it a lower roughness to achieve a metallic effect.

## Week 06 Develop in Blueprint

### Main tasks of game development:
**1. Player character functions (UI, shoot, pick up objects, dialogue)**

**2. NPC Barbie character functions (ai patrol, chasing players)**

**3. Enemy character function (drops modules when attacked)**

### Develop Firstperson Character 

**Implement player movement, jumping, and shooting using the First-Person Game Template in UE5.**

**UI-HP bar**
  1. Make a PlayerState component to save the Player's HP and other data
  2. Mount playerState to Player blueprint
  3. Get HP data in the game UI blood volume control. (Get percent function)
    ![image](https://github.com/tomoko-tiba/Paradise_CCI_Graduation_Project2023/assets/41440180/a4115f50-c415-4e36-b977-557b06c4ef98)


**Debug Process：** Unable to display correct health bar   
1. It was found that the result of calculating the percentage of the health bar is always 0, but the correct HP value can be obtained.
   
    ![image](https://github.com/tomoko-tiba/Paradise_CCI_Graduation_Project2023/assets/41440180/9bfc4e80-7359-4ca0-a73d-0deb1ebb556e)

3. The guess is that the error is caused by data type conversion in the division function.
   
5. The HP value type saved by the PlayerState component was changed from int to float, which was successfully solved.

**Bug:** During chatting, selecting options requires the mouse, but this causes a conflict as the camera moves with the mouse movement.

**Debug:** The solution is to set a Boolean variable 'IsChatting'; mouse control of the camera movement is only allowed when 'IsChatting' is false.

## Week 08

### Develop Enemy Character

Refer to the shooting and bullet generation logic in the First-Person Template; when the Enemy is hit by a bullet, generate parts.

![image](https://github.com/tomoko-tiba/Paradise_CCI_Graduation_Project2023/assets/41440180/4980f697-87e7-4391-a604-1473b13b5d4f)

**Enable physics simulation**, and the modules will automatically display a falling effect from mid-air.

**Bug**: Hitting once triggers the effect twice.

**Debug**：In the collision preset settings of the Enemy, it must be set to block bullets; otherwise, the bullets passing through the enemy would trigger the effect again.

![image](https://github.com/tomoko-tiba/Paradise_CCI_Graduation_Project2023/assets/41440180/2e786965-1707-46d3-9bc6-51b27b951fff)

#### Destroy the module: The player needs to collect all the voice modules from the enemies to break the brainwashing control they have over Barbie.

Copy the blueprint of the PickupActor, modify its logic, and change the trigger statement to a prompt that says 'Press J to destroy the module'

**Bug**:  Attempted to implement the 'Press J' key event in the Actor, but it cannot be triggered.

**Debug**:  Change to placing the code for destroying the module inside the PlayerCharacter.
![image](https://github.com/tomoko-tiba/Paradise_CCI_Graduation_Project2023/assets/41440180/b8baa9e1-c433-4527-a4fd-74a6fdbc45aa)

When all the modules are destroyed, prompt the player to find the NPC Barbie to proceed to the next stage of the game.

When the player completes the previous stage, it is necessary to trigger Barbie's state to become non-aggressive and available for dialogue. This involves **communication between the First-Person Character Blueprint and the Barbie Character Blueprint**.

**Solution:** Use an **Event Dispatcher**, and assign the event in the Level Blueprint, to facilitate information transfer between the two blueprints.

## Week 09 User Testing & Iteration

During the mid-stage of the project, a demo of the game was developed. I invited three people for game testing and conducted interviews to gather feedback, resulting in the following opinions:

1. The dialogue options for characters are too limited and brief, lacking in storytelling depth.
2. There is no connection between the five NPCs, failing to form a cohesive story.
3. The game's objectives are unclear, leading to confusion about what to do during gameplay.
4. A bug causes multiple NPCs to chase the player simultaneously, making the game too difficult and causing visual confusion for the player.
5. The relationship between the machine-like enemies and the Barbie NPC in the game is unclear.

Reflecting on the feedback, I identified several shortcomings in the game:

1. Each NPC's script requires detailed descriptions to enable players to deeply understand the characters' backgrounds and emotional states. This would necessitate extensive story writing, potentially burdening players with excessive reading. Therefore, reducing the number of NPCs seems the best solution for now.
2. My storytelling skills are limited, making it challenging to craft compelling stories for entirely fictional characters. Adapting NPC stories from my own experiences could add more detail and emotional resonance with players.
3. Limited art resources and a small map size can easily lead to bugs with multiple NPCs chasing the player.
4. There is insufficient interaction feedback between players and enemies.

Plans for game iteration:

1. Create a simpler and more understandable game process, reducing the number of Barbie NPCs from five to one. The main objective for players will be to rescue this single Barbie.
2. Increase the number of enemies. After attacking enemies, they will drop parts containing brainwashing thoughts about women, explaining the game's background.
3. In terms of dialogue, increase the options and add more detailed descriptions, allowing players to gain a deeper understanding of the characters' backgrounds and emotional states. Also, enhance the coherence and logic of dialogue scenes to improve the storytelling.
4. Make the game objectives clearer and more explicit. Players should know what they need to do to better enjoy the game. I will add more guidance and hints to help players understand the game objectives better.

## Week 10 Enrich The Details

1. **Use Sequencer to Create Opening Animation**: Implement Unreal Engine's Sequencer to produce an engaging opening animation. This tool allows for sophisticated cinematic creation, enabling the integration of various elements like camera movements, character animations, and environmental effects to craft a visually compelling introduction to the game.

2. **Refine Game Instruction Copy, Utilize ChatGPT for Optimization**: Focus on improving the game's instructional text. This involves revising prompts, directions, and any other written guidance provided to the player within the game. I used ChatGPT to generate copy. These tools can assist in enhancing the clarity, conciseness, and engagement of the text, ensuring that instructions are easy to understand and align with the game's overall tone and style.
