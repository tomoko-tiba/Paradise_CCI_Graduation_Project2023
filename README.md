**Design Background**

My project stems from a family gathering where I overheard my aunt loudly telling my mom, "Your daughter's legs are too fat." On the way back home, I complained to my mom, saying that my aunt's criticism of my body was very impolite. My mom's response was that we cannot control what others say. Others criticize you because the fact is that your legs are thick. At that point, my dad chimed in, suggesting that if I didn't want people to talk about me that way, I should simply wear long pants. I felt a deep sense of frustration during this exchange but found myself unable to effectively counter their arguments.

This experience is merely a common occurrence in my family. In China, there are numerous societal standards imposed on women, including being slender, fair-skinned, having a gentle personality, and enjoying housework, among others. When you don't conform to these standards, people feel entitled to criticize you. Should you attempt to push back, you may, like me, encounter even more criticism. This prevalent phenomenon prompted me to ponder **why so many women in Chinese society willingly uphold these patriarchal social standards and even use them to criticize other women.** Simultaneously, based on these reflections, I explored the **male gaze**, **societal norms**, and **their impacts on women** in my project.

### Research: Challenges Faced by Chinese Women

In my research, digital ethnography has been instrumental in exploring the narratives of women across diverse digital platforms. By analyzing content from social media, interview programs, and documentaries, I have compiled a comprehensive collection of 23 real-life female stories. Among these narratives, the story of **Liu Xiaoyang** from the CCTV program "Half the Sky" is particularly notable. She represents a woman with modern thoughts yet constrained by traditional female stereotypes, struggling to pursue her true aspirations due to societal norms. These narratives provide a rich tapestry of experiences, reflecting the multifaceted nature of women's lives in the digital age.

In an interview with a rural woman, XiaoYang Liu, conducted twenty years ago, she mentioned:

  - "Before a girl gets married, she belongs to her parents' family; after marriage, she belongs to her husband's family. "

  - "I have my own house, well-behaved children, and a loyal husband. **Others say that's already good enough.** But I'm not satisfied with just these. I want a fulfilling life; I want knowledge; I want to read books; I want to watch television to gain what I desire **because I can't go outside.** "

  - "If you break the conventional rules, you will feel helpless, hopeless, and lonely, **as if many eyes are watching you.** You don't need anyone to stop you; you will willingly abide by these rules."

  - "**I'd rather be in pain; I don't want to be numb.** I don't want to be someone who is content but knows nothing."

Over the past twenty years, her thoughts remain innovative and thought-provoking. Unlike XiaoYang, today's women in China have the right to access education, but some challenges faced by her still persist:
  1. **Overemphasizing the importance of “love" for women.** Pressuring women to be content with being subservient to men and using marital status as a measure of a woman's worth. 
  2. **Male gazing and regulation of women.** XiaoYang also mentioned these rules: "You can't be too bad, and you can't be too good." These rules still apply twenty years later, and they have become even more detailed as society has evolved.
  3. **Numbing women's thoughts and depriving them of self-awareness.** In Chinese family upbringing, the most common phrase is, “Girls don't need to read too many books."

**The Brainwashing Methods of Patriarchal Thinking in Modern Society**

How does patriarchal ideology affect women? In modern society, as women have gained independence of thought, conventional preaching and oppressive methods are no longer as effective. Consequently, **it conceals itself within media and culture, such as movies and novels, where patriarchy is repackaged as romantic plotlines**, subtly implanting itself in the minds of women.

Firstly, in the portrayal of female **protagonists** in Chinese television dramas, **women's growth often depends on the help of men**. The kind but naive girl is always waiting for the rescue of her white knight. As Simone de Beauvoir mentioned in "The Second Sex" “**To be feminine is to show oneself as weak, futile, passive, and docile.** The girl is supposed not only to primp and dress herself up but also to repress her spontaneity and substitute for it the grace and charm she has been taught by her elder sisters. Any self-assertion will take away from her femininity and her seductiveness.”。

Secondly, female **supporting characters** often conform to **stereotypical images** under the gaze of patriarchy. For example, women who pursue power and status often use their bodies and appearance as shortcuts. Moreover, Female leadership roles are typically portrayed as unpopular figures. In the Chinese context, the term "女强人" (nü qiang ren), originally referring to a successful career woman, has taken on a pejorative connotation, representing a woman with a strong personality who is difficult to get along with and is not well-liked by men.

These movies, novels, and media achieve the brainwashing of women by** glorifying patriarchy** and creating deceptive happiness for women. In these storylines, women appear to receive preferential treatment, and they don't need to put effort into studying and working because men will provide them with emotional and especially financial support. **Women seem to have easier choices, but this solidifies gender inequality.** As Lindsey German once mentioned in "Theories of Patriarchy," female liberation needs to begin with an assessment of the material position of women in capitalist society."

"Girls don't need to work so hard." I've heard it countless times during my upbringing. People encourage women to choose jobs that are less demanding, with lower stress levels and more free time. It means having more time to take care of the family. Negatively speaking, such jobs often come with lower salaries, higher replaceability, and lower competitiveness in the workplace. This seemingly woman-centric perspective, in reality, weakens women's power and status. **What's even more alarming is that this kind of thinking is adopted as a behavioral norm by a significant number of women.**

In the Chinese version of "The Second Sex," there may be a more precise description of such phenomena. "The great fortune of man lies in the fact that, whether in adulthood or childhood, he must embark upon an exceedingly arduous path, yet this is also the most reliable path. The misfortune of woman, on the other hand, is to be surrounded by almost irresistible temptations; everything entices her to take the easy road. She is not required to strive upwards, to walk her own path; **she is told that simply by sliding downward, she can reach the paradise of bliss.** When she discovers that she has been fooled by a mirage, it is already too late; her strength has been exhausted in futile adventures." (From "The Second Sex," Page 728)

How to make women consciously adhere to and uphold patriarchy? It constructs a pink paradise for women, where they are promised love, an effortless life path, and the belief that enhancing their appearance will yield more resources. **It leads women to believe that as long as they conform to patriarchal social standards and cater to the male gaze, they can obtain the maximum benefits.** However, behind this paradise lies patriarchy, which often includes any social, political, or economic mechanism that evokes male dominance over women. **Because patriarchy is a social construction, it can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.** This is especially crucial for teenagers, who, due to their less mature cognitive development, are more susceptible to the temptation of such a deceptive paradise. **Only by shattering the illusions of this paradise can we awaken the self-awareness of more women and propel the achievement of gender equality.**
