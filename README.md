Design Background

My project stems from a family gathering where I overheard my aunt loudly telling my mom, "Your daughter's legs are too thick." On the way back home, I complained to my mom, saying that my aunt's criticism of my body was very impolite. My mom's response was that we cannot control what others say. Others criticize you because the fact is that your legs are thick. At that point, my dad chimed in, suggesting that if I didn't want people to talk about me that way, I should simply wear long pants. I felt a deep sense of frustration during this exchange but found myself unable to effectively counter their arguments.

This experience is merely a common occurrence in my family. **In China, there are numerous societal standards imposed on women,**** including being slender, fair-skinned, having a gentle personality, and enjoying housework, among others. ****When you don't conform to these standards, people feel entitled to criticize you.** Should you attempt to push back, you may, like me, encounter even more criticism.

This prevalent phenomenon prompted me to ponder **why so many women in Chinese society willingly uphold these patriarchal social standards and even use them to criticize other women. **Simultaneously, based on these reflections, I explored the male gaze, societal norms, and their impacts on women in my project.
